# Blockchain-in-Javascript
Understand Blockchain-behind the scenes by building your own ground-up in Javascript

Blockchain essentially has 4 basic building blocks :

1. Data Structure
2. Network
3. Consensus algorithm
4. Cryptographic Algorithm to secure the data structure

Here, we systematically break down the various aspects into their fundamental rendering and build up the components step by step:

1. Blockchain data structure and POW algorithm (Blockchain.js)
  - Blockchain meant to store signed transactions or signed data in blocks.
  - Blocktime of 20 secs
  - SHA256 to sign transactions and secure the blocks
  - Proof of work consensus algorithm
  - A difficulty adjstment algorithm to keep the mining rate to the blocktime
